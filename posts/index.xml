      <description>Some useful gpg commands I recently ran into a problem with some gpg encrypted file, where the files were encrypted with another key than they were supposed to. Therefore I had to reencrypt them with another key. Every time I run into an unusual task with OpenGPG I find myself banging my head into a wall of useless documentation. Hereâ€™s some of the useful commands I found which let me resolve the issue:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old blog wasn&#39;t updated in a long while, and I have planned to move from
Jekyll to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; for a long while, so I finally set up everything.. I&#39;m actually
not sure where the source for my old blog is, but if I find it, I might
republish some older stuff. And I have planned to publish more content soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;books-mentioned-at-devopsdays-oslo-2017&#34;&gt;Books mentioned at devopsdays Oslo 2017&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of books mentioned during the talks at Devopsdays Oslo 2017.
I compiled a list of all the books mentioned. If you want to see the talks, you can find links to the recordings on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-oslo/welcome/&#34;&gt;Devopsdays website&lt;/a&gt; (the books
are listed by the speaker)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Devopsdays Oslo 2017, there was a discussion about machine learning at one of
the one of the openspace sessions. I made some notes from the session, and put
it into a gist that I shared on twitter. This is essentially that gist, so not
much editing here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
