      <description>Summing up the CS3 conference 2019 This year started with a visit to Rome and the 5th edition of the CS3 (cloud services for synchronisation and sharing) - a yearly European conference that started as a workshop between Universities, National Research and Education networks and Research Centres in an attempt to exchange experiences in extending traditional storage technologies to the cloud.
This was my second visit to the conference, last time was two years ago, and I worked for the University of Oslo and visited primarily because of my interest in sync and sharing solutions.</description>
